The market is showing consistent selling pressure throughout the day, making it risky to add new positions at this time.\n\n**No trade recommendation:** \n- Current market shows bearish momentum across BTC, ETH, and SOL\n- Already have SOL exposure representing ~10% of portfolio\n- Better to wait for clearer bullish signals before deploying remaining KRW\n- Current risk-reward ratio doesn't favor new entries\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
